# Voting-management-

I will be using remix IDE for my demo.


There will be two candidates added to the candidates mapping.
One will be candidate1 and another will be candidate 2.

To vote for candidate 1, click on the vote button on the left side after keying in the value of 1.

To vote for candidate 2, click on the vote button on the left side after keying in the value of 2.

To close the voting press on the Close Voting.
